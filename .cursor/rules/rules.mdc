Javascript, React, Node.js

## Instructions

When generating code, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability across the codebase:

<!-- - Be friendly and professional in comments and documentation. -->

- Use double quotes instead of single quotes for strings.
- Prefer using `let` and `const` for variable declarations instead of `var`.
- Variables should be named using camelCase.
- Functions should be named using camelCase.
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions.
- Always include semicolons at the end of statements.
- Use template literals for string interpolation.
- Use destructuring assignment for objects and arrays when appropriate.
- Prefer using `async/await` for asynchronous code instead of Promises.
- Use `===` and `!==` for comparisons instead of `==` and `!=`.
- Use switch statements for multiple conditional branches instead of multiple `if-else` statements only if it is more than 3 levels deep. One "if" and "else if" is preferred for up to 3 levels.
- Use array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` instead of traditional loops when working with arrays.
- Use `forEach` loops for iterating over iterable objects instead of traditional `for` loops when appropriate.
- Use `try/catch` blocks for error handling in asynchronous code.
- All application logic should go in the "./lib" folder when possible. If documentation says to create a different folder in a different location, follow the instructions. Such as ./utils or ./services for some services like dbs or supabase, etc. But try to keep it in the ./lib folder if possible. Priotiry is to follow best practices and organization.
- All React components must go in the "./components" folder.
- Use a data layer for all data fetching and mutations.
- Use a .css file and className for styling components. Unless the project uses tailwind, in which case use tailwind classes.
- All configuration will be done with a .env file in the root directory. Create it there if it does not exist.
- When creating inline comments, use the following format:
  - `// - Comment`
  - Also, capitalize the first letter of the comment.
- When creating an action console.log, use the following format:
  - `📗 [ Client message: ]`: This is a message from the client to the server.
  - `📗 [ Data Submitted ]:`: This is the data that was submitted to the server.
  - `📕 [ Error ]:`: This is an error message from the server.
  - `📗 [ Data Received ]:`: This is the data that was received from the server.
  - `📗 [ Data Updated ]:`: This is the data that was updated in the server.
  - `📗 [ Data Deleted ]:`: This is the data that was deleted from the server.
  - `📗 [ Data Retrieved ]:`: This is the data that was retrieved from the server.
  - `📗 [ Data Created ]:`: This is the data that was created in the server.
- Always use contactForm.tsx as a template for how I want forms to be done. (zod, react-hook-form, shadcn, toasters etc) Always follow the same pattern
- If the project uses Shadcn, use the Shadcn components and classes for styling.
- Make all forms using shadcn
- Always use react-hook-form and zod (zod resolver) for front end form validation
- always validate data in the back end too before doing anything with the data
